Electrokinesis 

Unlike Thermo which effects most things around you, Electro Kinesis is all about personal defense and and making enemies regret taking you head on while also having some nuances 

electrokinesis creates a shroud around the user after spending psi points, ((Shimmering Shroud)), the amount of psi-points spent adds to a Potency Counter in the Effect Associated ((Shimmering Shroud's Potency)) 

What does Shimmering Shroud do, and what does it represent:

When the creature in question has the Shimmering Shroud Effect, they gain a pleathora of benefits associated to essentially becoming a living battery. The Potency of the ability, which may or may not be immediately distinguishable to the player provides a bunch of effects which, only display themselves when the player reaches certain potency requirements. Potency will be tied to both the duration of the ability, which both accumulatively and decummuilitivly lowers the said duration and the 'ammunition' required to perform certain actions as depicted below.

Effects to be sorted into potency

Potency = the force of your 1500 (or 1.5V) 
Ability Increase Potential - 1 - its threshold where it maintains itself is around Electric Charge
Percentage of voltage decreases cost of electric charge, current Potency is affected by your maximum Charge
damage scale = x 0.1 per Potency
Decay Threshhold = half of current Electric Charge





Eletric Charge Scaling:

-   1 Electricity Resistance amplified by potency.
    Exchange Potency for Charges in Cells that take Electric energy only. 

-   2 Wood Starts burning on impact with you

-   3 -

-   4 - Charge Sense, detect conductive things around you. 

-   5 -

 - 6 When struck with a weapon that has metals or conductive materials within it, you now deal electric damage to your enemies. If wearing Metal armor, enemies will take this damage if they are using anything that is both conductive or counts as a natural bodypart.

- 7 weapons you wield gain the Electric effect, so long as they are made of steel or is a metallic weapon. 

9 Potency
- Electricity Resistance amplified by potency.
- Exchange Potency for Charges in Cells that take Electric energy only. 
- When struck with a weapon that has metals or conductive materials within it, you now deal electric damage to your enemies. If wearing Metal armor, enemies will take this damage if they are using anything that is both conductive or counts as a natural bodypart.
- weapons you wield gain the Electric effect, so long as they are made of steel or is a metallic weapon. 
- blocking with a metal shield will shock your enemies, potentially stunning them and dealing damage.
- Laser damage does reduced damage to you.
- Robotic enemies that manage to strike you must make a Toughness Saving throw or be stunned/take electric damage amplified by your Potency.

10-14 Potency
- Electricity Resistance amplified by potency.
- Exchange Potency for Charges in Cells that take Electric energy only. 
- When struck with a weapon that has metals or conductive materials within it, you now deal electric damage to your enemies. If wearing Metal armor, enemies will take this damage if they are using anything that is both conductive or counts as a natural bodypart.
- weapons you wield gain the Electric effect, so long as they are made of steel or is a metallic weapon. 
- blocking with a metal shield will shock your enemies, potentially stunning them and dealing damage.
- Laser damage Does no damage to you.
- Robotic enemies that manage to strike you must make a Toughness Saving throw or be stunned/take electric damage amplified by your Potency.

15-17 Potency
- Electricity Resistance amplified by potency.
- Exchange Potency for Charges in Cells that take Electric energy only. 
- When struck with a weapon that has metals or conductive materials within it, you now deal electric damage to your enemies. If wearing Metal armor, enemies will take this damage if they are using anything that is both conductive or counts as a natural bodypart.
- weapons you wield gain the Electric effect, so long as they are made of steel or is a metallic weapon.
- blocking with a metal shield will shock your enemies, potentially stunning them and dealing damage.
- Laser damage does no damage to you and you now absorb Electricity as extra Potency.
- Robotic enemies that manage to strike you must make a Toughness Saving throw or be stunned/take electric damage amplified by your Potency.

18-21
- Electricity Resistance amplified by potency.
- Exchange Potency for Charges in Cells that take Electric energy only. 
- When struck with a weapon that has metals or conductive materials within it, you now deal electric damage to your enemies. If wearing Metal armor, enemies will take this damage if they are using anything that is both conductive or counts as a natural bodypart.
- weapons you wield gain the Electric effect, so long as they are made of steel or is a metallic weapon. 
- blocking with a metal shield will shock your enemies, potentially stunning them and dealing damage.
- Laser damage does no damage to you and you now absorb Electricity as extra Potency.
- If an attack that has the electric trait fails to penetrate or deal damage to you, you absorb the electricity adding it to your potency.
- for one charge, you can fire an shimmering ray beam not unlike flaming hands, called Shimmering Hands
- Robotic enemies that manage to strike you must make a Toughness Saving throw or be stunned/take electric damage amplified by your Potency.

release a emp blast on activation that deactivates eletrical items around
Now every sqaure around you at random intervals the eletricity striking enemies, a bit of charge is being used which natural decreases your potential which weakens it overtime.

Self Destruct 


Now, when you have high potency or any potency, certain things like stepping into water, will set off a discharge effect that passes into other water squares, this automatically lowers the potency, meaning you have to avoid water while having high potency, the amount it gets lowered by is a set random, however the discharge into water spreads from where the player is standing and anything caught in it will take damage and possibly be stunned/dazed
