Umbranimea

An aura of darkness is about you, stealing the light from the world around you. You hide your light--along with your glimmer.

Umbral aura is a mental mutation that, unlike Light Manipulation, does the inverse, creating a space of darkness around the player that cuts enemy line of sight (hopefully) the ability also makes one more difficult for glimmer-sensing entities to find you and invisible to both clairvoyance and Sense Psychic.

Cast a shadow on an area or emit a constant fume of darkness around yourself. You are innately more difficult to sense through the glimmer, abilities like clairvoyance, and sense psychic are less effective on you.

ideas for balancing mutations

Combustion Blast, add a psi buff debuff if they fire too many charges in a row, possibly add a "Charges Fired Threshold" which essentially will be a duration that, checks how many times you fired psi charges during this tick down, which will scale with your level.


Ideas for Umbral

possibly create something like walls that have a part that register's their distance from the player, despawning themselves when the player leaves a cell, vanish on a check, creating the illusion of sight occlusion
or it creates a lingering visual effect, that is instead maybe like a gas that blocks vision and then dissipates after some time.

alright, time to learn to make food

time to make chitin husk into a recipe.
